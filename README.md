[demo](https://fps.hnr.bz)

Simple first person shooter game to be played in a browser.

The game is written in javascript and uses the [three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [cannon.js](https://github.com/schteppe/cannon.js) libraries.

The player can move around with WASD, shoot with Left-Click and jump with Space.

The game is a proof of concept.
