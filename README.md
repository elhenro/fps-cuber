# FPS Cuber 
Simple first person shooter game to be played in a browser. [demo](https://fps.hnr.bz)

The game is written in javascript and uses the [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) and [cannon.js](https://github.com/schteppe/cannon.js) libraries.

The player can move around with WASD, shoot with Left-Click and jump with Space.
